# Project dependencies
#
# The original prototype depended on a number of heavy libraries such as
# `ollama`, `chromadb-client` and `sentence-transformers`.  To simplify
# installation and remove any need for network access those requirements have
# been eliminated.  Only Django is strictly necessary to run the web
# application and requests is included for potential future integrations.

Django>=4.2,<5.0
requests>=2.25,<3.0
# Include the `ollama` client so that the application can connect to a local
# ollama server and list/generate language models.  If you do not wish to
# integrate with Ollama you can remove this line.
